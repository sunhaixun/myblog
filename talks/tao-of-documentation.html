<h1>Tao Of Documentation</h1>
<p>
Most developers hate having to do documentation, yet we complain about how tools and libraries we use lack documentation. So, the question is how do you get developers to write good documentation without having to feel like they are wasting their time. There are plenty of good documentation tools out there such as TomDoc, YarDoc, and RDoc. These tools are useful for creating documentation for tools, gems and varies open source projects and each one has it's unique way of making documentation easier for developers.

How do you manage documentation for a product? At Engine Yard we have our AppCloud product and having good external documentation for our customers is very important to us. We want to make sure they can easily understand how to use our product and be able to accomplish what they need. However, it has been difficult to get good documentation out quickly.
